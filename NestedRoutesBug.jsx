In React Router Dom v6, using the `useParams` hook inside a component that's not directly nested within a route matching the params can lead to unexpected behavior.  The params might be undefined or contain stale values, especially when navigating dynamically or with nested routes. This is because `useParams` only works correctly within the component that's directly under the route using the `:` parameter. For example, if you have a route `/users/:userId` and try to access `userId` in a component several levels deep without a corresponding route path in between, the value will be incorrect or null.
