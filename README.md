This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in React Router Dom v6 related to the `useParams` hook. The bug arises when using `useParams` outside of a component that directly corresponds to a route path containing parameters. The solution showcases how to properly access parameters through route nesting or by passing them down as props.
